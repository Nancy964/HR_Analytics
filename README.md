# HR_Analytics
# 📊 Overview
This project presents a dynamic HR Analytics Dashboard created using Power BI. The dashboard is designed to help companies analyze and visualize employee attrition patterns. By identifying trends related to age, salary, job roles, education background, gender, and tenure, HR teams can make data-driven decisions to reduce turnover and improve retention.
# Problem Statement
Employee attrition (voluntary or involuntary turnover) can significantly impact business productivity, morale, and cost. Without proper data analysis, it becomes challenging for organizations to understand:
1. Why are employees leaving?
2. Which departments or roles are most affected?
3.Is there a pattern in employee exits based on age, gender, or salary?
# 🎯Purpose of the Dashboard
The purpose of this HR dashboard is to:
  • Monitor overall attrition and identify high-risk areas     
  • Help HR departments make informed decisions on retention strategies      
  • Provide management with visual evidence to guide policy changes      
  • Track attrition across various employee demographics and job roles
